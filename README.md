# Vending Machine Project for TPRG 2131 

## Overview
This project simulates a vending machine that accepts coins, dispenses products, and returns change. The vending machine is controlled using a graphical user interface (GUI) made with PySimpleGUI. It also incorporates a state machine to handle different operations like accepting coins and dispensing items.

## Functional Requirements
- The machine accepts coins (5¢, 10¢, 25¢, $1, $2).
- The machine dispenses products when enough money is inserted.
- The machine calculates and returns the correct change.
- The GUI allows users to interact with the vending machine, select products, and insert coins.

## Features
- GUI with coin input buttons and product selection.
- State machine for managing states such as accepting coins and dispensing products.
- Integration with Raspberry Pi GPIO for hardware interaction.
- PyTest for testing the functionality of the vending machine.

## Marking
